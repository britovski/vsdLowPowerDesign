# vsdLowPowerDesign

Low Power Design Workshop repo

## Description
This repository is a summary of the 5-day workshop of Low Power Design course provided by VSD.

## Day 1

First is provided some key concepts that will be covered on this course and outcomes.

Some important concepts are presented (provoked) as really important thins as Power vs Energy!


### Fundamental
Some concepts introduced:
- Board design x chip design
- packages x chip/die (composed by PADs + core) x IC
- Foundry IP's x IP's x Macros

### RISC-V ISA
An introduction to RISC-V architeture is done.
- Translation from high-level language to machine code is presented: C --> ASM --> binary code (compilator + assembler)
- Implementation of the RISC-V ISA can be performed using HDL in the front-end side and layout in the back-end side. For exemple: picorv32 CPU core.
- (Apps. --> System Softwares --> Hardware) real execution flow.
SoC is introduced by Raven and picoSoC examples (RISC-V based SoCs).
- SoC is related to the synthesizable logic in a chip. Ex: Raven Chip = Raven SoC + RAM blocks + analog IP's.

### Design tools
An introduction to IC Design flow and tools are performed. The goal is to show the RTL2GDS flow using opensource tools.
- Beginning with logic synthesis (using Yosys);
- Floorplanning;
- Placement (graywolf);
- Clock Tree Synthesis - CTS;
- Routing (Qrouter);
- Static Timing Analysis - STA (Opentimer);
* MAGIC layout viewer and editor is presented. Also used for equivalent circuit extraction and DRC;
* ngspice is presented for pr√© and post-layout simulations;
* eSIM is also presented for SPICE simulations with schematic capture functionality and also with PCB design capabilities;
Last but not least, Qflow is presented as a complete tool chain (using tools as Yosys and graywolf) for complete RTL2GDS flow.

Some examples using qflow gui is presented, as well as vsdflow (that is a script which uses .csv configuration files with the purpose to check if opensource tool flow is ok).
- vsdflow invokes qflow.
